# NBA Facts
A web app that fetches NBA players data from the first half of the 2017-2018 season and returns it to the user.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript


## Optimizations
If I had the time I would fix an issue with NBA players that have multiple first or last names or any suffix(it will not return a picture for these players because of the way the query parameter is set up). I would also fix an issue with the team abbreviations and the nba-color api I used. Some of the team abbreviations are different between this API and the stats API causing the colors not to change for some teams.
